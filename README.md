# Aim of the Project
The need to have a consistent method for underwater wireless communication and data collection is of foremost importance for monitoring underwater environment and exploration.
In Oceanography research, autonomous underwater Vehicles (AUV) and Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUV) are used to observe the environmental phenomena at a fixed location over a long period.  But deep sea divers go underwater on different mission. They set out to document the underwater world or scientific diving, including marine biology, geology, hydrology, oceanography and underwater archaeology. Divers generally are trained to use hand signals to communicate within their group. They also use underwater writing boards, which allow better communication. Both these require light. If the water is murkier or if it is night time the communication becomes difficult. This leads to the need to provide low latency, high bandwidth
Communication method for underwater communication for divers. Underwater wireless communications can be carried out through acoustic, radio frequency (RF), and optical waves. This hardware idea intends to present and implement new methods to overcome these challenges.
